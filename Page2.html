<!--Counter Terrorists-->
    <div id="CT">
      <h1 id="H1">Counter-Terrorists</h1>
      <p id="B1">The name states it all, you are against the terrorists.
        Being a CT requires strategy and tactics because weapon wise you are at a disadvantage.
        Although in most maps CTs have an advantage over map control, this is where your strategy comes into play.
        In CT, your weapons costs more money and deal less damage, therefore you must have game sense nad tactics to deal as musch damage without being killed.
        There are different goals for CTs in diffrent maps. In Bomb maps, your objective is to eliminate the enemy, defuse the bomb, or run down the time.
        On the other hand, on hostage maps, your main goal is to rescue the hostage without injuring him, bring him to the rescue pad, while defending whoever has him on your team.
        This might sound discouraging but the CT has a couple of tricks up its sleeves. One, in the pistol round the CT start of with a USPS, a one tap one, one kill pistol, very effective in long range.
        This gives major advantage to the CT's on pistol rounds. Second, CT's will always have the advatage of suprise.
        The CT's spawn is usually close to the sites, therefore they are able to set up even before the terrorists come.</p>

<!--Terrorist-->
    <div id="T">
      <h1 id="T1">Terrorists</h1>
      <p id="B2">Countering the Counter-Terrorists, are of course the Terrorists!!! Obviously, opposite of the CT, the terrorist dooes require as much "mind power" to play successfully.
      With a balance bigger than the CTs, cheaper and more powerful weapons, the Ts are almost unstoppable. The possible one reason why Ts are not the garunteed win is because the Ts have map disadvantage.
      The CTs are able to get into site faster than the Ts, this gives them time to setup and camp corners. What balances this out is the Ak weapon characteristic of 1 tap one kill.
      Like opposite of the Ct's objective, the terrrorists job is to plant, eliminate, and detonate the bomb. While this is accurate for most maps, its not fully accurate.
      In hostage scenerio, the Ts job is to protect the hostage from the CTs, kill the CT that has the hostage, or run down time. </p>
