        <div id="B1"><p>Born on the August of 2012, Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a first person, multi multiplayer online, and shooting game.
          It is one of the four main Counter Strike games and possibly the most popular.
          CS:GO was developed by Hidden Path Entertainment in coopertation with Valve Company.
          Through its cross-platform capabilities, Counter-Strike ever growing community never stops.
          With it's "modding" capabilities never-ending, players will never get bored of the game. Currently, CS:GO offers 5 game modes for online play, and 2 for offline mode.
          Another reason why CS:GO is such a popular favored game is because of its community and the relationship between the developers and players.

          Of course this can be changed with "mods", but thats for another day.
          There are two teams in CS:GO, the Counter-Terrorist and the Terrorists.
          For most maps, the CT's job is to defend a bomb-site from the Ts, if they failed to do so they must take back the site and defuse the planted bomb.
          On the other hand, the T's job is to attack a bomb-site, plant the bomb, and then prevent the CTs from defusing the bomb.
          There are cases where in some maps the roles are switched, the Ts must defend a hostage, while the CTs try to rescue said hostage.</p></div>
